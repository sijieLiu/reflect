NEXT: 
- recenter/rescale SVG
- player/goal positions (wtf is up with the Y coord??)
		just use color to differentiate? heh
- book keeping code for levels
		why not actually just keep all levels in a single SVG? they're all simple anyway..use different IDs and groupings

LATER:
- have "folding" background! if we can get a bg texture that matches the initial geometry, this should make everything render nicely without the need to tesselate polygons and stuff?

STORY/LYRICS:

Life is simple when my goals are clear (star)
Even when they seem impossible (star)
But sometimes, things become uncertain (? block)
And I need to do some self-reflection (mirror)
Should I seek money? (coin)
Should I seek love? (heart)
Should I seek status? (ribbon)
Should I seek approval? (thumbs up)
Or just be myself? (self)
But am I who I want to be? (white self)
Can I improve myself? (taller self)
Or should I just accept my faults? (self)
What is worth suffering for? (crown of thorns)
What is worth years of my life? (sand timer)
When should I just give up? (surrender flag)
Am I thinking too much? (brain)
