PLAYTEST: 
- use Inkscape exported PNG to draw and reflect level geo
	- probably should use python to cut up individual pieces, to keep texture sizes small.
- slope issues - just use CharacterController - GIVE UP EGO!
- make line of reflection extend the whole screen
- add per-level tutorial/story text

- SERIOUSLY consider grid-snapping (and angles) to keep things less fidgety..
	- although the grid bg helps already
- disallow reflections that put player out of mesh

PRODUCTION:
- add UV scrolling bg animation..

PRODUCTIVITY:
- 

STORY/LYRICS:

Life is simple when my goals are clear (star)
Even when they seem impossible (star)
But sometimes, things become uncertain (? block)
And I need to do some self-reflection (mirror)
Should I seek money? (coin)
Should I seek love? (heart)
Should I seek status? (ribbon)
Should I seek approval? (thumbs up)
Or just be myself? (self)
But am I who I want to be? (white self)
Can I improve myself? (taller self)
Or should I just accept my faults? (self)
What is worth suffering for? (crown of thorns)
What is worth years of my life? (sand timer)
When should I just give up? (surrender flag)
Am I thinking too much? (brain)
