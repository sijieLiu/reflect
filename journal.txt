NEXT: 
- SvgBuilder needs to handle multiple pieces, ie. maintain its own edge list. Just have it contain a Mesh2D..
- Add # of allowed reflections, as XML parameter in levelArea rects
- add per-level tutorial text

LATER:
- have "folding" background! if we can get a bg texture that matches the initial geometry, this should make everything render nicely without the need to tesselate polygons and stuff?

STORY/LYRICS:

Life is simple when my goals are clear (star)
Even when they seem impossible (star)
But sometimes, things become uncertain (? block)
And I need to do some self-reflection (mirror)
Should I seek money? (coin)
Should I seek love? (heart)
Should I seek status? (ribbon)
Should I seek approval? (thumbs up)
Or just be myself? (self)
But am I who I want to be? (white self)
Can I improve myself? (taller self)
Or should I just accept my faults? (self)
What is worth suffering for? (crown of thorns)
What is worth years of my life? (sand timer)
When should I just give up? (surrender flag)
Am I thinking too much? (brain)
